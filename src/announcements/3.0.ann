The Torque team is pleased to announce the 3.0 release!

http://jakarta.apache.org/turbine/torque/

Torque is a persistence layer. Torque generates all the database resources
(sql scripts + java om/peer classes) required by your application and includes a
runtime environment to run the generated classes.

Torque was developed as part of the Turbine Framework.
It is now decoupled and can be used by itself.

The Torque team is pleased to announce the 3.0 release!

http://db.apache.org/torque/

Torque is a persistence layer. Torque generates all database-related
resources used by most applications (SQL scripts and Java object
model/persistance mapping classes) required by your application.  It
includes a runtime environment to run the generated classes.

Torque was developed as part of the Turbine Framework, but has been
decoupled and can be used separately.

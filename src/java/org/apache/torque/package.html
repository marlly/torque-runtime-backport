Torque is an object-relational mapper for Java. In other words, Torque lets you access and 
manipulate data in a relational database using java objects. Unlike most other 
object-relational mappers, Torque does not use reflection to access user-provided classes, 
but it generates the necessary classes (including the Data Objects) from an XML schema 
describing the database layout (which can either be written by hand or generated from an 
existing database). The XML schema can also be used to generate and execute a SQL script 
which creates all the tables in the database.

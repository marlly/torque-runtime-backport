# Workaround to allow building from the source distribution.
# In cvs, the extends path is ../../project-base.xml,
# whereas in the source distribution, the extends path is 
# project-base.xml
# The property in this file controls the path for the cvs version.
# The property can be removed as soon as maven distributes a 
# project.xml where the <extends> is already resolved.
# Outside building from the source distribution, this property has 
# no effect.

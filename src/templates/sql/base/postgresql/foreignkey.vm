## The following will only work for non-circular references
## if you have a dependancy chain, you will need to use
## ADD CONSTRAINT syntax (with INITIALLY DEFERRED)
## which is sticky and version dependant
##
#foreach ($fk in $table.ForeignKeys)
ALTER TABLE $table.Name
    ADD CONSTRAINT $fk.Name FOREIGN KEY ($fk.LocalColumnNames)
    REFERENCES $fk.ForeignTableName ($fk.ForeignColumnNames)
#if ($fk.hasOnUpdate())
    ON UPDATE $fk.OnUpdate
#end
#if ($fk.hasOnDelete())
    ON DELETE $fk.OnDelete 
#end
;
#end

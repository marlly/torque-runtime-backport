This patch allows a program to traverse the Map Builder and its
database, table and column maps to examine and modify the Torque
generated objects.

At the moment, the ColumnMap contains only the SQL name of a column
which can differ from the java name used for introspection (and in the
generated beans) by using the javaName attribute in the XML file.

You must rebuild your schema and your application after applying this
patch because some of the method signatures in the TableMap class are
changed.

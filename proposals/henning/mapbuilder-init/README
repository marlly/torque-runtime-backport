This is a simple patch for the Torque generator which allows Torque to
build an additional per-Schema class. This class has only one static
method, init() which adds all the mapbuilders from the schema to the
Torque core.

I needed this to have a defined way to find all the tables defined in
a schema from a database. As normally, the map builders are registered
when a peer is used for the first time, I could not see a way to get a
list of all defined peers without this.

After you applied the patch to torque and rebuilt your schema, you
will get an additional package, called db with a single class called
<your database name capitalised>Init. If your database is called
"petshop", your class will be called PetshopInit.

After invoking PetShopInit.init(), all your peers will have their map
builders registered with Torque.

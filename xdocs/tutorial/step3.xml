<section name="Step 3: Invoking Torque">

<p>
With the configuration of Torque completed, you can now
generate the object model to support your database, and
optionally create your database and all of its
associated tables.  As mentioned earlier in this
tutorial, Torque utilizes Ant to perform these tasks.
Each of these tasks is covered in the following
sections.
</p>

</section>

<section name="Generating the Object Model and Associated SQL">

<p>
  The generation of your object model will produce
  Java source files that can be used to represent your
  database.  These classes enable you to create, edit,
  delete, and select objects that represent rows in
  your database tables.  In addition, Torque will
  generate SQL to create your database tables (you
  have the option of executing the SQL as demonstrated
  later in this tutorial).
</p>

<p>
  The object model consists of four classes for each
  table in your schema.  For example, the
  <em>author</em> table, defined in this tutorial,
  will result in the following four classes:
  <em>Author</em>, <em>AuthorPeer</em>,
  <em>BaseAuthor</em>, and <em>BaseAuthorPeer</em> (a
  discussion on the use of these classes is deferred
  until we write our sample application).
</p>

<p>
  To generate your object model and the associated
  SQL, type the following command in the top-level
  <em>torque</em> directory:
</p>

<source><![CDATA[
ant -f build-torque.xml
]]></source>
<p/>

<p>
  Upon a successful build, indicated by the
  &#145;BUILD SUCCESSFUL&#146; message, you will find
  a new <em>torque/src</em> directory.  It is here
  that you will find the generated Java classes and
  generated SQL.
</p>

<p>
  The Java classes are located in the <em>java</em>
  directory and will be in a directory hierarchy
  matching that of the <em>targetPackage</em> you
  specified in your Torque <em>build.properties</em>.
  These are the files that will be compiled into your
  object model classes.
</p>

<p>
  The SQL files are located in the <em>sql</em>
  directory.  For each database schema in your
  <em>torque/schema</em> directory, there will be a
  corresponding file with a <em>.sql</em> extension
  instead of <em>.xml</em> extension.  The contents of
  these files are the SQL commands that can be used to
  manually or automatically (see next section) create
  your database tables.
</p>

<p>
  If you encounter errors while building, it is more
  than likely a formatting error of your database
  schema file.  Check the format of the file and make
  sure it conforms to the
  <a href="../schema-reference.html">
  Torque Schema Reference</a>.
</p>

</section>

<section name="Creating the Database and Tables">

<p>
  As mentioned previously, Torque can automatically
  create your database and all of the associated
  tables for you.  However, you must first make sure
  that the appropriate database driver (the one you
  defined in <em>build.properties</em>) is in your
  classpath so that Torque can connect to your
  database and execute the generated SQL commands.
  The easiest way to accomplish that is to add your
  database driver to the <em>torque/lib</em>
  directory.  Ant's build file automatically adds all
  of the jar files in this directory to its classpath.
</p>

<p>
  <b>
    Note: Torque will <em>drop</em> the database and
    tables that it is about to create if they exist!
    You should skip this step if you are working
    with an existing database full of data.
  </b>
</p>

<p>
  To create your database, type the following command
  in the top-level <em>torque</em> directory:
</p>

<source><![CDATA[
ant -f build-torque.xml create-db
]]></source>

<p>
  To create your tables, type the following commands in
  the top-level <em>torque</em> directory:
</p>

<source><![CDATA[
ant -f build-torque.xml id-table-init-sql
ant -f build-torque.xml insert-sql
]]></source>

<p>
  Note: if this tutorial had not utilized Torque's
  <em>idbroker</em> method (as described earlier), it
  would not have been necessary to execute the
  <em>id-table-init-sql</em> target.
</p>

<p>
  Success will be indicated by the &#145;BUILD
  SUCCESSFUL&#146; message.  You can also validate
  this by checking your database.  For example, the
  <em>bookstore-schema.xml</em> and
  <em>id-table-schema.xml</em>, defined in this
  tutorial, should have created a database called
  <em>bookstore</em>, with the following tables:
  <em>ID_TABLE</em>, <em>author</em>, <em>book</em>,
  and <em>publisher</em>.
</p>

<p>
  If you encounter errors while creating your
  database, it is more than likely a misconfiguration
  of your <em>build.properties</em>.  Another common
  problem is that the user specified in the
  <em>build.properties</em> does not have sufficient
  privilege to create databases and tables.  In either
  case, refer to the section above that explains the
  <em>build.properties</em> file.
</p>

</section>

<p>
Now that you have generated all of your object model
classes and created your database, you are now ready to
build your first Torque application.

<section name="Step 1: Obtaining the Torque Distribution">

<p>
  First, you need to obtain the Torque
  <a href="http://jakarta.apache.org/builds/jakarta-turbine/torque/release/">
  distribution</a>.
  Note that for this tutorial, you should NOT use the CVS version
  of db-torque instead of the normal release version, since the
  Torque CVS tree has a differing directory layout; thus it's unsuitable
  for this example (at least if you're a newbie who doesn't know how to
  configure the CVS version properly, which is probably true
  for most people that are reading this tutorial).
</p>

<p>
  After you have obtained your copy of the Torque, you can either
  unpack the jar and integrate all of the Torque files into your
  source tree, or keep Torque in the jar and use it via the classpath.
</p>

<p>
  This tutorial will take the former approach. See <a href="../jar-guide.html">jar
  guide</a> for a description of the latter approach.
</p>

<p>
  You need to unpack the Torque jar to a directory where
  you want to develop your application.  This will create
  a directory called <em>torque</em>.  It is here that you
  will configure Torque and build your application.

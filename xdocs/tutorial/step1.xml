<p>
  First of all, note that Torque is divided into three parts.
  <ul>
    <li>
      The generator generates your persistence classes from an xml
      description of the database. It also generates and executes
      sql scripts to create all the necessary tables, constraints etc.
      in your database.
      The generator comes packaged in two jars: The templates in
      torque-gen-templates.jar, and the rest in torque-gen.jar.
    </li>
    <li>
      The maven plugin integrates the generator into
      <a href="http://maven.apache.org/">Maven</a>, a software
      project management tool. In other words, the maven plugin is
      a frontend for the generator.
    </li>
    <li>
      The runtime has to be included in your projects for the generated classes
      to work properly.
    </li>
  </ul>
  For this tutorial, we will be using the maven plugin for Torque 3.2.x
  (which will silently invoke the generator) to
  generate our object model classes and sql scripts. For working with the
  generated classes, we will use the Torque 3.2.x runtime for our
  sample application.
</p>

<p>
  If you have not already done so, download and install
  <a href="http://maven.apache.org/">Maven</a>. It is highly recommended to use
  version 1.0.2 of Maven.
</p>

<p>
  Maven uses the <a href="http://www.ibiblio.org/maven">ibiblio maven repository</a>
  to download any libraries and resources it needs. From there, obtain the Torque
  maven plugin by typing
</p>

<source><![CDATA[
maven plugin:download -DartifactId=maven-torque-plugin -DgroupId=torque -Dversion=3.2-rc2
]]></source>

<p>
  You do not need to download the generator or the
  runtime separately. Maven will download them from
  the ibiblio distribution site automatically
  when they are needed.

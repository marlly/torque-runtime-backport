<section name="Step 1: Obtaining the Torque Distribution">

<p>
  For this tutorial we will be using the maven plugin for Torque 3.1.1 to
  generate our object model classes and the Torque 3.1.1 runtime for our
  application that makes use of the generated classes.
</p>

<p>
  If you have not already done so, download and install 
  <a href="http://maven.apache.org/">Maven</a>.  You then need to obtain the 
  Torque maven plugin.  The <a href="../maven-howto.html">Maven Howto</a> 
  includes details of how to build the maven plugin from source, but you can 
  easily install a binary distribution thus:
</p>

<source><![CDATA[
!!! TO DO - The binary plugn is yet to be deployed, in the mean time you must build the plugin from source. !!!
!!! TO DO - Confirm these values !!!
maven plugin:download -DartifactId=maven-torque-plugin -DgroupId=maven-torque-plugin -Dversion=3.1.1
]]></source>

<p>
  At runtime the generated object model classes need access to the Torque 
  runtime distribution and associated libraries - these are available from the
  <a href="http://jakarta.apache.org/builds/jakarta-turbine/torque/release/3.1.1/">
  Downloads page</a> (the file to download is torque-3.1.1.tar.gz or 
  torque-3.1.1.zip, depending on your development platform).  We will cover
  what to do with this file in a later step.

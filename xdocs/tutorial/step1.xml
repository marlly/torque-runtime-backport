<section name="Step 1: Obtaining the Torque Distribution">

<p>
  First, you need to obtain the Torque
  <a href="http://jakarta.apache.org/builds/jakarta-turbine/torque/release/">
  distribution</a>.
</p>

<p>
  After you have obtained your copy of the Torque, you can either
  unpack the jar and integrate all of the Torque files into your
  source tree, or keep Torque in the jar and use it via the classpath.
</p>

<p>
  This tutorial will take the former approach. See <a href="../jar-guide.html">jar
  guide</a> for a description of the latter approach.
</p>

<p>
  You need to unpack the Torque jar to a directory where
  you want to develop your application.  This will create
  a directory called <em>torque</em>.  It is here that you
  will configure Torque and build your application.

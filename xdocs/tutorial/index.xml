<section name="About this Tutorial">

<p>
  This tutorial is intended to give first-time users an
  introduction to using Torque, an object-relational tool.
  Torque was developed as part of the Turbine web
  application framework.  Until recently, it was tightly
  coupled in that framework, and could not be used
  independently.  This tutorial is an introduction to the
  decoupled version of Torque.
</p>

<p>
  This will include how to obtain the Torque distribution,
  setting up a database, and writing a sample application
  to demonstrate the power of Torque.  The tutorial is not
  meant to be an exhaustive introduction to Torque, please
  refer to the documentation on the
  <a href="index.html">Torque homepage</a> for more
  detailed information.
</p>

<p>
  The example used throughout this tutorial is based on an
  email sent to the <a href="/site/mail.html">
  turbine-user</a> mailing list by Steven F. Davis
  called
  <a href="http://archives.apache.org/eyebrowse/ReadMsg?listName=turbine-user@jakarta.apache.org&amp;msgNo=5287">
  torque outside turbine - detailed example (long)</a>.

<section name="Managers - Intro">
  <p>
    Note: Managers and the caching they provide is fairly new (as this is
    written on 2002-04-11).  Feedback is welcome and usage by the brave
    is encouraged.  But the api should not be expected to be stable.
  </p>
  <p>
    A manager is responsible for instantiating new objects, retrieving stored
    objects, and possibly caching these objects.  Managers provide static 
    accessors for much of its functionality, so usage examples are:
  </p>

  <source><![CDATA[
    Foo foo = FooManager.getInstance(); // gets a new Foo.
    // id is an ObjectKey that identifies the object in the db
    foo = FooManager.getInstance(id);
    // ids is a List of ObjectKey's that identifies objects in the db
    List foos = FooManager.getInstances(ids); 
  ]]></source>

</section>

<section name="Business Object Cache">

  <p>
    If no-arg constructor of FooManager, 
    calls setRegion(region) where the String region is the key used to
    determine the cache, the manager will cache instances of Foo retrieved
    via the getInstance(ObjectKey id) and getInstances(List ids) methods.
    One possibility for the region key is the 
    fully qualified classname with dots replaced by underscores. 
  </p>

  <source><![CDATA[

    public FooManager()
        throws TorqueException
    {
        setRegion("net_bar_om_Foo");
    }

  ]]></source>

  <p>
    The key given for the region is used in a JCS
    configuration file, cache.ccf, to set up a cache that the manager uses
    to store objects for which it is responsible. See the Stratum JCS 
    <a href="http://jakarta.apache.org/turbine/stratum/index.html">
    documentation</a> for details on configuring JCS.  But here is a 
    simple section that creates an in-memory only LRU cache for FooManager.
  </p>

  <source><![CDATA[

jcs.region.net_bar_om_Foo=
jcs.region.net_bar_om_Foo.cacheattributes=
    org.apache.stratum.jcs.engine.CompositeCacheAttributes
jcs.region.net_bar_om_Foo.cacheattributes.MaxObjects=1200
jcs.region.net_bar_om_Foo.cacheattributes.MemoryCacheName=
    org.apache.stratum.jcs.engine.memory.lru.LRUMemoryCache

  ]]></source>

  <p>
    It is a good idea to set a region for each manager, but this behavior 
    is optional.  There also will be no caching if JCS is 
    not configured for the region given in the Constructor.
  </p>

  <p>
    The generated object model classes have methods for getting objects 
    that are related by foreign keys.  If the FOO table contains an fk to
    the BAR table then Foo.getBar() will exist.  This method uses
    BarManager.getInstance(bar_id) and therefore will return a cached
    Bar, if the Bar has been previously requested (and it still exists in
    the cache.)
  </p>

</section>

<section name="Method Result Cache">

  <p>
    The above fk relationship will also generate a Bar.getFoos(Criteria).  It
    would be preferrable that repeated requests to this method returned
    cached results as opposed to hitting the db for each call.  It could be
    possible to add such caching to the generated method, and Criteria
    implements an equals() method that would make this possible.  But 
    determining the equality of a Criteria is complex and possibly buggy (this
    is the perception of the author of this doc, there are no known bugs).
    Invalidating the results has also not been reduced to templated Java code.
    So whether to cache these kinds of results is left to the developer
    who is using torque.
  </p>

  <p>
    It is a good practice to write methods within Bar that wrap the
    getFoos(Criteria) method.  The conversion from application parameters
    to a Criteria is then implemented in a more maintainable manner.  For
    example:
  </p>

  <source><![CDATA[

public List getFoos(FooType type, boolean deleted)
{
    List result = null;

    Criteria crit = new Criteria();
    crit.add(FooPeer.TYPE_ID, type.getId());
    crit.add(FooPeer.DELETED, deleted);
    result = getFoos(crit);

    return result;
}
  ]]></source>

  <p>
    In the above code the database will be hit for every call to the method.
    BarManager provides some convenience code to add caching to the above 
    method, so it can be rewritten as:  
  </p>

  <source><![CDATA[

public List getFoos(FooType type, boolean deleted)
{
    List result = null;
    Boolean b = (deleted ? Boolean.TRUE : Boolean.FALSE);
    Object obj = BarManager.getMethodResult().get(this, "getFoos", type, b); 
    if ( obj == null ) 
    {        
        Criteria crit = new Criteria();
        crit.add(FooPeer.TYPE_ID, type.getId());
        crit.add(FooPeer.DELETED, deleted);
        result = getFoos(crit);

        BarManager.getMethodResult().put(result, this, "getFoos", type, b);
    }
    else 
    {
        result = (List)obj;
    }
    return result;
}

  ]]></source>

  <p>
    The getMethodResult() method returns a MethodResultCache object, which
    creates a key from the arguments given in the get method.  All the
    arguments must be Serializable.  The first object should be the business
    object on which the method was called.  If the object is not Serializable
    or the method is static, a String as given by Object.toString() method or
    the className might be used.  The second argument is the method name.
    There are versions of the get method that take up to 3 additional arguments
    that will be the arguments to the method, or if they are not Serializable
    some Serializable proxy.  There is also a get method that takes an
    Object[] that can be used for methods that have more than 3 arguments; the
    first two objects in the array should be the instance and method name.
    The reason for not just having the Object[] format is that keys are pooled
    and since most methods will be less than 4 arguments, object creation
    related to the cache is minimized.  Now the method will return cached
    results as long as the results remain in the cache. So there must be some
    way to invalidate these results, if the database changes in a way that
    is likely to affect the result that should be returned by the method.
  </p>

</section>

<section name="Invalidating the Cache">

  <p>
    An event model exists for invalidating cached method results.  Continuing
    the example from above, BarManager should register itself as a listener 
    with the FooManager.
    Then FooManager will notify BarManager, if a foo.save() is called
    that might affect its cached results.  The following code is added to 
    BarManager.java which implements the CacheListener interface.
  </p>

  <source><![CDATA[

    /**
     * Method should be overridden to notify other managers with 
     * relevant CacheEvents.
     */
    protected void registerAsListener()
    {
        FooManager.addCacheListener(this);
        XManager.addCacheListener(this);
        ...
    }


    // -------------------------------------------------------------------
    // CacheListener implementation

    public void addedObject(Persistent om)
    {
        if (om instanceof Foo) 
        {
            getMethodResult().removeAll(om, "getFoos");
        }
        else if (om instanceof X) 
        {
            getMethodResult().remove(om, GET_URLS);
            getMethodResult().removeAll(om, GET_COMMENTS);
        }
        ...
    }

    public void refreshedObject(Persistent om)
    {
        addedObject(om);
    }

    /** fields which interest us with respect to cache events */
    public List getInterestedFields()
    {
        List interestedCacheFields = new LinkedList();
        interestedCacheFields.add(FooPeer.BAR_ID);
        interestedCacheFields.add(XPeer.X_ID);
        ...
        return interestedCacheFields;
    }

  ]]></source>

  <p>
    When a foo which is of interest to BarManager is saved, the instance is 
    passed
    to the appropriate listener method.  This object may contain information
    that could result in no action or possibly more precise repair of the
    cached data.  In the above examples the cache is just cleared of all
    data that is potentially invalid. 
    Some code is also added to FooManager to support the invalidation.
  </p>

  <source><![CDATA[

    /**
     * Creates a new <code>FooManager</code> instance.
     */
    public FooManager()
        throws TorqueException
    {
        setRegion("net_bar_om_Foo");
        validFields = new HashMap();
        validFields.put(FooPeer.BAR_ID, null);
    }

    protected Persistent putInstanceImpl(Persistent om)
        throws TorqueException
    {
        Persistent oldOm = super.putInstanceImpl(om);
        List listeners = (List)listenersMap.get(FooPeer.BAR_ID);
        notifyListeners(listeners, oldOm, om);
        return oldOm;
    }                

  ]]></source>

  <p>
    Now FooManager will notify BarManager when foo's are modified.

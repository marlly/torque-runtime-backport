<a href="http://jakarta.apache.org/turbine/">Turbine</a> application framework.

<section name="Sybase Howto">

<p>
This text is a description of integration of Sybase ASE as the target
database in a TDK generated application.  
</p>

</section>

<section name="JDBC Driver Information">

<p>
Sybase has a pure java jdbc driver, jConnect, that is free to use, but not
open source.  You may download this driver from 
<a href="http://www.sybase.com/products/eaimiddleware/jconnectforjdbc/">Sybase</a>.
</p>
</section>

<section name="Integration Steps">

<OL>
<LI>Generate your application with the TDK as normal.</LI>
<LI>Edit the project properties as instructed by the TDK.</LI>
<LI>
Before you run 'build.sh init' you will need to create the
database.  Automatic database creation for Sybase does not currently
work, so the database must be created first.
</LI>
<LI>Place the jConnect jar file in your WEB-INF/lib directory.</LI>
<LI>Run 'build.sh init' to generate and initialize the project.</LI>
</OL>

<p>
<UL>
<LI>
The .sql files that the TDK build process generates files with the
sql command terminated by a ; for use in the sql directive provided by
the Ant build system.  These scripts will not work properly if run by
hand via the 'isql' command. 
</LI>
<LI>
The .sql files to create the tables, do not correctly remove any
constraints on the tables currently and may fail.  Drop the tables by
hand, then re-run 'build-project.sh insert-sql' to re-create and
populate the tables.

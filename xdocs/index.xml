    <section name="Torque Runtime">
      <p>
        The Torque runtime is the only part of Torque you need after you
        have generated the persistence classes using the Torque Maven plugin
        resp. the Torque generator.  It contains the classes the generated
        classes depend on.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        This section contains information about how to work with the generated
        classes.  For information of how to generate these classes, see the
        <a href="../maven-plugin/index.html">Maven plugin reference</a>
        or the
        <a href="../generator/index.html">generator reference</a>.

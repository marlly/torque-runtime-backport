o Torque should be fully functional on its own, but right now
  it doesn't work as a persistence layer without the DBService
  in Fulcrum. The classes should be moved from Fulcrum into
  this repository and Torque should be made to work on its own
  and be embeddable in applications. The DBService in Fulcrum
  should be a wrapper around Torque.

o Separate the connection pool and make it pluggable
  so that torque can easily be integrated into other application
  that already use PoolMan, or the commons connection pool, or
  the struts connection pool or whatever

o XML an configuration

o Use the digester to turn the datamodel into an object and
  get rid of the dependency on xerces. It would be nice to 
  use the digester with MinML so that the distribution can
  be tiny

o Get rid of the Log wrapper in all the code and use the log4j
  Category c = Category.getInstance(classname) method so
  that torque can easily be integrated into other apps. Either
  log4j or the logging API will dominate and I'm going to take
  log4j. But as Ceki has noted they are so similar it is very
  easy to change from one to the other

o Some analysis on what we actually have would be prudent. Torque
  is somewhat based on the work of Scott Ambler and I would like
  to know where it is the same and where it diverges so we know
  what we're dealing with.

o find all other OSS persistence layer projects and see if
  we can join forces.
  
o separate the runtime system from the generation tools, place
  them in different packages.

o using cursors to allow controlled access to a large set
  of data. typically there is no need to see a massive
  set of records all at once.
  
o using proxies for large objects. if you had a user object
  that had 50 attributes it would more efficient to create
  a proxy object of that user that might have a few attributes,
  enough to identify the object. you might use the proxy
  objects in a list and when it is selected the real user
  object is transparently retrieved.
  
o would it be possible to support native connection methods
  for high efficiency. an easy to access C APIs, would it
  even be useful?

o application programmers should be able to save, update, and
  delete objects without any knowledge of the database schema.
  if the attribute selection is based on columns in tables than
  the object hierarchy and database schema cannot vary
  independently. it is likely that the database schema may need
  to change but you don't want this to affect application
  programmers who may know little about databases. reasonably
  so, the persistence layer should take care of everything.
